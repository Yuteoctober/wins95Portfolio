  - Resize window (using Resize: both on CSS (not supported by mobile))
  - Hide and unhide
  - One click to highlight
  - Double Click to open (also works on mobile using usestate to capture the first touch and counting time within 3ms)
  - Introduce Clippy assistant, who always gives you inspirations
  - now Clippy has function to show up and give you advices, when you click on certain thing
  - Added Shutdown Button
    - Shutdown
    - Restart
